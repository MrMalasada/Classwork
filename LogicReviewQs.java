/*
* 1. A boolean is a primitive data type that holds true or false
*
* 2. this code will only run when test == true
*
* 3. that code will only run when test == false
*
* 4a. The difference between the two code statements is that in
* A, "other code stuffs" will only run when test == false and 
* code stuffs and other code stuffs will never run at the same time.
*
* In B, code stuffs and other code stuffs are in independent
* if statements. Code stuffs will only run when test == true, and other code
* stuffs will only run when test2 == true. In this case, it is possible for
* code stuffs and other code stuffs to run at the same time.
*
* 4b. In case A either code stuffs and other code stuffs are garunteed to be
* ran as long as test is being ran.
* 
*
* In case B code is not garrunteed to be ran, if test and test2 
* are both false, then no code will run at all
*
* 5. code3 will never run because test is a boolean, true or false,
* since there are already cases for test being true and false, code3 is unreachable code
*
* 6. code3 will only run when test and test2 are both false
*
* 7. Yes, the two code snippits will do the same thing
*
* 8. No, the code snippiets do not do the same thing they are essentially opposites of eachother.
*
* 9a. !a || !b
*
* 9b. !a && !c
*
* 9c. q != p 
*
* 9d.  !z < !x
